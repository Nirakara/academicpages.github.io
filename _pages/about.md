I am a master's student of biomedical imaging at ETH Zurich, expecting to graduate in April, 2017. My focus areas are medical image analysis and machine learning, augmented with the understanding of medical image acquisition techniques. I am very excited about the potential of data-driven approaches in aiding complex biomedical analyses and would like to continue working at the intersection of machine learning and medical image analysis.

Before coming to the wundersch√∂ne Schweiz, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and worked with Philips Healthcare R&D for two years.
