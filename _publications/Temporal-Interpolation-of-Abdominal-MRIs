# Abstract
We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based solution for temporal image interpolation in navigated 2D multi-slice dynamic MRI acquisitions. Such acquisitions can achieve high contrast time-resolved volumetric images without the need for breath-holding, which makes them essential for quantifying breathing induced motion for MR guided therapies.
Reducing the number of navigator slices needed in these acquisitions would allow increasing through-plane resolution and reducing overall acquisition time.
